tsdl-mixer â€”  SDL2\_mixer bindings for OCaml with Tsdl
------------------------------------------------------

Tsdl\_mixer provides bindings to
[SDL2_mixer](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_mixer/) intended to
be used with [Tsdl](http://erratique.ch/software/tsdl).

It has as siblings [tsdl-image](https://github.com/sanette/tsdl-image)
and [tsdl-ttf](https://github.com/sanette/tsdl-ttf).

Note that these bindings are at an early stage and have only been used
minimally.  The interface may change.  Comments and bug reports are
welcome through the
[github page](https://github.com/sanette/tsdl-mixer).

## Installation

Via [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/):

    opam install tsdl-mixer

## Documentation

Documentation is
[here](https://sanette.github.io/tsdl-mixer/Mixer/index.html). It can
be generated with `dune build @doc`, but the binding follows the
SDL2_mixer interface closely, so it may be sufficient to consult
[its documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_mixer).

Starting from version 0.3, the library is usable in a toplevel (with
`#require "tsdl-mixer"`).

## WARNING V0.3 Breaking change

Starting from 0.3, the library name is the same as the opam package
name `tsdl-mixer`. (The library name used to be `tsdl_mixer`, which
was confusing).
